function sequences(questions, level) {

    // 3 types of problems: additive, geometric, cyclical
    // 3 levels for each question: 
    //  - level 1: identifying them OR the pattern value (what the adder, multiplier is) OR the nth term for additive
    //  - level 2: finding the nth term for any additive or a reasonable term for geometric/cyclical
    //  - level 3: finding sums, differences or products of different answers
    //      - RNG the number of terms to manipulate
